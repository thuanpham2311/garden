# Â§Â§ what about zettelkasten + mind map?

- i think [peter draw have the good mind map](20211113231041.md) among of shit mind map out there, it have connection, focus to the goal, but i think this like brainstorming stuff, messy
- i really want to do what [Justin Sung](20211113231926.md) say about the mind map, it clean, simple visualization for me, i want make the mind map + zettelkasten work together
