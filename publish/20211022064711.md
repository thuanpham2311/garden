# The problem with active recall and spaced repetition

- yep, i try some active recall and spaced repetition before, i remember in high school i using flash card for first thing in English, biology and some class take me good score by the remember some stuff, you know most of thing in math in the high school i trust thing -> yep i have a frame work when i remember this frame and some relate stuff i will become good at math basically like this. I using the Anki app for to try remember the formula, but is seen like not work for me because i lazy to repeat and repeat something fucking boring with me, yep.
- basically this not bad but not good to try to better learning something, when you study in 8h but your brain your technical not good so 8h study → something like 2h (better thinking get better result).
- so what, you know learning like a skill to work with this, not like something the 10m in YouTube will help you to 0 → 100% yep, it's will be a long long time to get better learning and basically it's thinking your thinking must be training and you have to research difference things you fit with this, that the way i think.
